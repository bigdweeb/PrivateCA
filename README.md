These files will describe the process followed to create a private certificate authority in my lab.  I embarked on this project to gain a better understanding of how public certificate authorities work, as well as to provide valid certificates within my lab environment.

## Files
1. Creating a private root certificate authority
2. Creating a private intermediate certificate authority
